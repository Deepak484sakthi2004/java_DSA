## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code. This repository serves as a resource for Java developers to explore and implement various data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

Explore the following data structures implemented in Java in the folder Sheet_Problems:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- and more...

## Algorithms

Discover Java implementations of fundamental algorithms such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- and more...

## Daily LeetCode Practice

For solutions to these problems, check out my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/Alpha_warrior_23/). Each problem is linked to the respective LeetCode page for reference.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and integrate the code snippets into your Java projects. Each data structure and algorithm implementation is accompanied by comments for better understanding.
